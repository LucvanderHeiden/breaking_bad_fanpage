                Walter White is a loving husband and father. He is a highschool chemistry teacher and also has a sidejob as a carwash
                employee. On his 50th birthday he collapses and is diagnosed with an inoperable type of lungcancer. Instead of 
                counting down the days he starts producing crystal meth to make a lot of money for his family before his death. His 
                background in chemistry makes him an exceptionally good cook. His signature blue meth becomes so popular that Walt's 
                alias, Heisenberg, becomes an infamous name in all of the USA.

                one of the biggest druglords north of the border. When Walt's product starts to compete with Gus', he asks Walt to produce
                for him, offering him a very large sum of money in return.
