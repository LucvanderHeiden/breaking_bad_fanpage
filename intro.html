            <h2>The Story</h2>
            <p>The story of Breaking Bad sounds rather simple on paper, yet it stands at the basis of one of televisions greatest 
                  shows ever made. Walter White, age 50, lives a simple life with his wife, Skyler White
                  and son, Walter Jr. He works as a chemistry teacher in high school. This is until he is suddenly diagnosed with 
                  terminal lung cancer. His inevitable death makes him realise he won't be leaving much behind in terms of financial 
                  support for his family. <br> <br>
                  Walt's brother-in-law, Hank, works at the Drug Enforcement Administration. When Walt comes on a ride-along with Hank
                  to see him "bring down a meth lab" Walt realises there is a lot of money to be made selling drugs. He also finds out 
                  on of his former students, Jesse Pinkman, works as a drug manufacturer and dealer. Walt find Jesse and tells him about
                  his plan. Jesse thinks Walt must have lost his mind and does not think it is a good plan. However, Walt convinces Jesse
                  to give him a try anyways and so they become partners in crime.

            <h2>Chemistry</h2>
            <p>Walter White describes chemistry as "the study of change" and this perfectlly encapsulates the story of Breaking Bad. It
                shows us how certain situations and conditions can affect a person and how much people can change when they're desperate.
                As you watch the show you will see Walter go through a transformation of his own. Changing from a simple family man to something
                he would have never even expected himself to become.
